## Lack of Debugging:
Since my groupmate told me he dropped this course in the very last minute, I have to complete all the tasks by myself and I did not have enough time to debug this game, which should be my groupmate's job. 
I can not find other groupmates and schedule my time since he just told me a few days before deadline. I hope you can understand the condition if the program can not run very well.
